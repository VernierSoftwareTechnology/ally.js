# ally.fix.pointerFocusInput

This *Browser Bug Workaround* targets an issue in Safari and Firefox **on Mac OS X**, where focus would not be given to certain form elements upon `mousedown`. This is *not* a browser bug, it is *desired behavior by the OSX platform*. Use this feature only if you require the elements to receive focus (e.g. for custom styling).


## Description

> In Firefox for Mac, Chrome and Safari, some types of form field donâ€™t take the focus at all when clicked with the mouse; this behavior is limited to fields which have no typed input, such as radios, checkboxes, buttons, color-pickers and sliders.

## Usage

```js
// engage the workaround for the entire document
var handle = ally.fix.pointerFocusInput();
// disengage the workaround
handle.disengage();
```

```js
// engage the workaround only for a sub-tree
var handle = ally.fix.pointerFocusInput({
  context: '#element-to-fix',
});
```

### Arguments

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| context | [`<selector>`](../concepts.md#Selector) | [`document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) | The scope of the DOM in which to apply the fix. All elements of the collections are used. |

### Returns

A [`<service>`](../concepts.md#Service) interface, providing the `handle.disengage()` method to stop the service.

### Throws


## Examples

* **EXAMPLE:** [`ally.fix.pointerFocusInput` Example](./pointer-focus-input.example.html)


## Changes

* Since `v#master` nested elements of `<button>` and `<label>` are targeted properly.


## Notes

* **NOTE:** In Firefox the `<label>` element causes form fields to get focus upon being clicked, even if the form field itself would not get focus because of the ominous platform conventions.
* **NOTE:** Only engaged for Safari and Firefox on Mac OS X (detected via [platform.js](https://github.com/bestiejs/platform.js/)).
